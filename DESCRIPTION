Description: The main objective of cooperative games is to allocate a good among the agents involved. This package includes the most well-known
  allocation rules, i.e., the Shapley value, the Banzhaf value, the egalitarian rule, and the equal surplus division value. In addition,
  it considers the point of view of a priori unions (situations in which agents can form coalitions). For this purpose, the package
  includes the Owen value, the Banzhaf-Owen value, and the corresponding extensions of the egalitarian rules. All these values can be
  calculated exactly or estimated by sampling.
